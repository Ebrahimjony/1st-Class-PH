                This is a very adventurous movie. The story is very emotional and has a nice description of the animal and people life in Sunderbans. It dives deep into the dense forest there and also the places where dacoits live and Police can't reach there.
                It is very nice presentation of the life in Sunderbans.
                inshallah my allah blease me. I will good web Developer.

                Keep in mind that since your short story is, well, shorter than a novel, you may remove a few steps. Knowing the overall character journey, however, can be helpful for your main character development within short stories.
